It is the end of the 2018 regular season in MLB. The Chicago Cubs are on everybody's mind at my office, and of course it's hard for me to sympathize as a long-time Milwaukee Brewers fan living in Chicago. 

The dynamic right now is quite interesting. As of today, September 26, 2018, the NL Central standings looks as follows. The Cubs have a 0.5 game lead on the Brewers because they have played one less game. 

``` {r}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/standings_9_26_2018.png')
```

The Cubbies have 5 games left to play and the Brewers have only 4. If the division standings end in a tie for first place, a 1 game playoff will be played to crown the division champion. So, **What is the probability that the Brewers  will steal the division title from the Cubs?** The answer to this question can be estimated by identifying how likely it is the Brewers win at least the same number of games as the Cubs. This is equivalent to the Cubs losing at least 1 more game remaining than the Brewers. 

To approach this problem, I used a data model called the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution). In our use case, given **n** games left to play, and an underlying probability **p** of winning a game, this counting machine can measure the probability of any number of wins for a team using these 2 parameters. 

We'll apply this data model for each the Cubs and the Brewers probability of winning **X** more games and make some inference from the outputs.  

## Analytical Approach

To solve this analytically, we apply a little math magic to count the ways in which each team's remaining season can play out in terms of wins. . . 

1. I will use a function called `dbinom()` in the statistical programming language, `R`, to calculate the probability of winning **X** games with **n** left to play, given **p**, the team's winning percentage.

``` {r echo=TRUE}
brewers_wins <- dbinom(c(0,1,2,3,4), # plausible outcomes for Brewers wins
                       size = 4, # total games left
                       p =0.576) # probability of winning a game = current win %

cubs_wins <- dbinom(c(0,1,2,3,4,5),
                    size = 5, 
                    p =0.58)
```

  
2. Apply matrix multiplication to calculate the [joint probability](http://www.statisticshowto.com/joint-probability-distribution/) of the Cubs and Brewers winning exactly **X** of their remaining games (ex. Brewers win 1 more and Cubs win 3 more). In probability theory, you multiply probability of different events/outcomes when they are assumed independent of each other. Since the Cubs and Brewers don't play any more games against each other, this is a fair assumption to make. The plot below visualizes their joint probability distribution of all plausible win scenarios. 

``` {r}
brewers_wins_x <- matrix(brewers_wins,
                         dimnames = list(paste0("MIL_", c(0:4), "_Win"),"Brewers"))

cubs_wins_x <- matrix(cubs_wins, ncol=length(cubs_wins),
                      dimnames = list("Cubs", paste0("CHC_", c(0:5), "_Win")))
 
joint_x <- brewers_wins_x %*% cubs_wins_x

melt(joint_x) %>%
    rename(brewers = Var1, cubs = Var2, joint_prob = value) %>%
    mutate(brewers = stringr::str_extract(brewers, "[[:digit:]]+"),
           cubs = stringr::str_extract(cubs, "[[:digit:]]+"),
           text = ifelse(as.integer(brewers) >= as.integer(cubs), "*", "")) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=cubs, y=brewers, fill=joint_prob)) + 
        geom_tile(color = "white") + 
        geom_text(aes(label=text)) +
        scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", 
           midpoint = 0.065, limit = c(0,0.13), space = "Lab", 
           name="Joint\nProbability") +
        labs(title = "Joint Probability of Cubs and Brewers Remaining Wins",
             subtitle = "* indicates the outcomes favorable to Milwaukee tying or winning the Division",
             x= "Plausible # of Cubs Wins",
             y= "Plausible # of Brewers Wins") +
        theme_minimal()
    
```
  
3. Sum all the joint probabilities where the Brewers won the same number of games or more than the Cubs. This is the final probability answer to our question. If we sum all the tiles with marks on them, the probability of the Brewers tying or winning the NL Central division as of 9/26/18 are **`r round(sum(joint_x[lower.tri(joint_x, diag=TRUE)]),2)`**.


## Simulation Approach 

Simulation is an alternative approach instead of a direct analytical method like above. Simulation is popular as outputs can be manipulated directly in an intuitive way to count joint event outcomes between each team. So instead of calculating the probability mass function for each team of winning **X** games with **n** left to play, given **p**, the team's winning percentage, let's simulate thousands of random draws from these respective probability distributions and compare the simulated outputs to arrive at an estimate of **What is the probability that the Brewers  will steal the division title from the Cubs?**

```{r}
set.seed(123)
brewers_wins <- rbinom(n=10000, size=4, prob=0.576)
cubs_wins <- rbinom(n=10000, size=5, prob=0.580)

data.frame(brewers_wins, cubs_wins) %>%
    tidyr::gather(team, simulated_wins) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=simulated_wins, y=team)) + 
        ggridges::geom_density_ridges2(aes(fill=team), stat = "binline", binwidth = 0.5, scale =0.9) +
        labs(title = "10,000 Simulations of Cubs and Brewers Remaining Wins",
             subtitle = "Using the binomial distribution as a model of the data",
         x= "Simulated Remaining Wins",
         y= NULL) +
        scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,6), breaks = seq(0,6,1)) +
        theme_minimal() +
        scale_fill_manual(guide = FALSE, values = c("navy", "blue"))
```

Given the simulated distribution of wins for each team above, the Cubs have a better chance at getting 4 or 5 wins than the Brewers. But the modes are quite similar. Each the Cubs and Brewers are predicted to most likely get between 2 to 3 wins, given their winning percentages **p** and their number of remaining games, **n**. The probability that the Brewers will steal the division title from the Cubs 
can be estimated by comparing each of the 10,000 pairs of simulated wins between the teams, and measuring the proportion where the Brewers win as many or more simulations than the Cubs. In `R` code:

``` {r echo=TRUE}
round(mean(brewers_wins >= cubs_wins), 2)
```
We get the same estimated probability using simulation as we do using direct analytical methods!

## Let's check the results against other's projections

Now, is this extremely simple model realistic? I'm making predictions simply based upon each team's current 2018 season win percentage and no other contexts!

Let's get a reality check on whether this arbitrarily simple model gives us a reasonable estimate compared to a much more robustly built forecasting system. We can look to Nate Silver's www.fivethirtyeight.com
and their [MLB standings projections](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-mlb-predictions/?ex_cid=rrpromo) for comparison.

``` {r}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/538_mlb_projections_9_26_2018.png')
```

It looks like their projections as of today are similar to my simple models above at a 43% chance of the Brewers taking the division from the Cubs. 

## Final Thoughts

If you're a Brewers fan, you'll take a 43-47% chance of winning the division this weekend, given how September started in the standings. If you're a Chicagoan, an approximate coin toss chance of keeping hold of the NL Central division entering this weekend is going to call for a large bottle of Tums.
